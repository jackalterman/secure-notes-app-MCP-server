# SecureNote.link MCP Server

üåê [securenote.link](https://securenote.link) - Try the secure note sharing service in your browser!

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides secure, end-to-end encrypted note sharing capabilities. This server integrates with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible applications to enable AI agents to securely share sensitive information.

## Features

- üîê **End-to-End Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption ensures your secrets stay private
- üì§ **Secure Message Sharing**: Send encrypted messages with customizable expiration times (1, 24, 72, or 168 hours)
- üî• **Burn-After-Reading**: Secrets are automatically deleted after being viewed once
- üîì **Two Sharing Modes**: 
  - **Convenient**: Single-click URLs for quick sharing
  - **Maximum Security**: Separate URL and decryption key for sensitive data
- üõ°Ô∏è **Password Protection**: Add an extra layer of security with optional passwords
- üîç **API Health Monitoring**: Check server status and connectivity
- üß∞ **Flexible Integration**: Use as an MCP server or integrate with your own applications
- üìù **Developer Friendly**: Includes manual decryption functions and detailed documentation
- ü§ñ **Agentic Workflows**: Endless possibilities for AI agents to securely share and retrieve sensitive information

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- The [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) Python library (installed automatically by setup)

---

## Quick Setup

### 1. Add the MCP Server to Claude Desktop or Cursor

#### Claude Desktop

1. **Find your Claude Desktop config file:**
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```powershell
     code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
     ```

2. **Add the MCP server configuration:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "secure-notes": {
         "command": "python3",
         "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/secure_note_mcp.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/secure_note_mcp.py` with the full path to your script.

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** to apply the changes.

#### Cursor (or other MCP-compatible clients)

- Add the MCP server in your client's settings, using the command:
  ```bash
  python3 /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/secure_note_mcp.py
  ```
- Or, if the client supports a GUI, add a new MCP server and point it to the script above.

---

### 2. Build and Run with Docker

You can run the MCP server in a Docker container for easy deployment and isolation.

#### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t securenote-link-mcp .
```

#### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/your/config:/app/config \
  --name securenote-link-mcp \
  securenote-link-mcp
```
- Mount any config or secrets as needed (optional).

#### Use the Dockerized MCP Server in Claude Desktop or Cursor

- Update your Claude Desktop or Cursor config to use the Docker command as the MCP server:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "securenote.link": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run", "--rm", "-i", "securenote-link-mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  - This will launch the MCP server in a container each time it's needed.
  - Make sure Docker is running and the image is built.

**Choose the method that best fits your workflow!**
- For local development, running the Python script directly is easiest.
- For isolation, reproducibility, or server environments, Docker is recommended.

## Tool Reference

### 1. `send_secure_note`
**Convenience Sharing (One-Click URL)**

Encrypts a message, stores it via the API, and generates a single, shareable URL that embeds both the secret ID and the decryption key.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (required): The secret message to encrypt and send
- `password` (optional): Additional password protection
- `expires_in` (optional): Expiration time in hours (1, 24, 72, or 168)

**Returns:**
- A single URL containing both the secret ID and the decryption key (in the URL fragment)
- Security notes and usage instructions

**Use Case:**
- Share a single link for convenience.

---

### 2. `send_secure_note_return_api_url_and_key`
**Maximum Security Sharing (Two-Channel)**

Encrypts a message, stores it via the API, and returns the retrieval URL and decryption key separately for maximum security.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (required): The secret message to encrypt and send
- `password` (optional): Additional password protection
- `expires_in` (optional): Expiration time in hours (1, 24, 72, or 168)

**Returns:**
- API retrieval URL (returns JSON, not a user-facing page)
- Decryption key (base64-encoded)
- Security notes and usage instructions

**Use Case:**
- Maximum security workflows where you want to share the URL and key through different channels

---

### 3. `retrieve_and_decrypt_secret`
Retrieves and decrypts a secret from the API using the provided secret ID and decryption key.

**Parameters:**
- `secret_id` (required): The ID of the secret to retrieve
- `decryption_key` (required): The decryption key (base64 encoded)
- `password` (optional): Password if the secret is password protected

**Returns:**
- The decrypted message
- Secret ID

**Use Case:**
- Use with the output of `send_secure_note_return_api_url_and_key` for maximum security

---

### 4. `check_api_health`
Checks if your secure notes API is running and healthy.

**Returns:**
- API health status, server info, uptime, version, and URL

**Use Case:**
- Troubleshoot connectivity or server status

---

### 5. `get_instructions`
Provides a comprehensive guide on how to use this secure note sharing service, including encryption details, workflows, and tool descriptions.

**Returns:**
- Detailed documentation covering encryption process, sharing workflows, and tool usage

**Use Case:**
- Get help understanding how to use the service effectively
